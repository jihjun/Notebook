> Trying to setup Modbus Slave on Mitsubishi PLC, and How to find the device memory that is not in used?

I am trying to add a serial communications card on an existing L series controller. I would like to create a modbus slave.

Now I am setting up the predefined protocol. and seems I need to write the parameters into a memory location and assign the memory locations in the setting.

Am I in the right track?
